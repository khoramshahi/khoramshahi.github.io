The goal of this work is to enable robots to intelligently and compliantly adapt their motions to the intention of a human during physical Human–Robot Interaction in a multi-task setting. We employ a class of parameterized dynamical systems that allows for smooth and adaptive transitions between encoded tasks. To comply with human intention, we propose a mechanism that adapts generated motions (i.e., the desired velocity) to those intended by the human user (i.e., the real velocity) thereby switching to the most similar task. We provide a rigorous analytical evaluation of our method in terms of stability, convergence, and optimality yielding an interaction behavior which is safe and intuitive for the human. We investigate our method through experimental evaluations ranging in different setups: a 3-DoF haptic device, a 7-DoF manipulator and a mobile platform.
