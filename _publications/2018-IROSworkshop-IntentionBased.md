The goal of this work is to enable robots to intelligently and compliantly adapt their motions to the intention of a human during physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) in a multi-task setting. We employ a class of parameterized dynamical systems that allows for smooth and adaptive transitions across encoded tasks. To comply with human intention, we propose a mechanism that adapts generated motions (i.e., the desired velocity) to those intended by the human user (i.e., the real velocity) thereby switching to the most similar task. We investigate our method through experimental evaluations for different robotic scenarios.
