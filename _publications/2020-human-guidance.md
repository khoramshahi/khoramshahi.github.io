A seamless interaction requires two robotic behaviors: the leader role where the robot rejects the external perturbations and focuses on the autonomous execution of the task, and the follower role where the robot ignores the task and complies with human intentional forces. The goal of this work is to provide (1) a unified robotic architecture to produce these two roles, and (2) a human-guidance detection algorithm to switch across the two roles. In the absence of human-guidance, the robot performs its task autonomously and upon detection of such guidances the robot passively follows the human motions. We employ dynamical systems to generate task-specific motion and admittance control to generate reactive motions toward the human-guidance. This structure enables the robot to reject undesirable perturbations, track the motions precisely, react to human-guidance by providing proper compliant behavior, and re-plan the motion reactively. We provide analytical investigation of our method in terms of tracking and compliant behavior. Finally, we evaluate our method experimentally using a 6-DoF manipulator.
